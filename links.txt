Is there a file search engine like "Everything" in Linux?
You may have a look at rlocate, a reimplementation of locate that is always
up-to-date.  Another interesting project is recoll which also supports real
time indexing and allows you (like beagle) additionally do full-text searches.
Finally I should mention doodle which also supports real time indexing.  For
doodle there are some nice frontends like catfish.
Note that you can also make (r)locate results clickable by using for example
urxvt as terminal-emulator and by writing something like
  URxvt.perl-ext: default,matcher URxvt.urlLauncher: /usr/bin/gnome-open     
  URxvt.matcher.button: 1 URxvt.matcher.pattern.1: /.*
(and executing xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults afterwards)
