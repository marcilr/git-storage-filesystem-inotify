Inotify

inotify is an inode-base file system notification mechanism.


(Taken from the wikipedia for inotify http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify)

"........
  inotify is a Linux kernel subsystem that provides file system event
  notification.  It was written by John McCutchan with help from Robert Love and
  later Amy Griffis to replace dnotify.  It was included in the mainline kernel
  from release 2.6.13 (2005-06-18), and could be compiled into 2.6.12 and
  possibly earlier releases by use of a patch.  Its function is essentially an
  extension to filesystems to notice changes to the filesystem, and report
  those changes to applications.

  Its major use is therefore arguably in desktop search utilities like Beagle,
  where its functionality permits reindexing of changed files without scanning
  the filesystem for changes every few minutes, which would be very
  inefficient.  By being told that a file has changed directly by the kernel,
  rather than actively looking, Beagle and such utilities can achieve
  change-to-reindexing times of only about a second, with very small
  performance hits (inotify therefore enables the use of such programs in a
  sensible manner; daemons are generally not accepted by distributors if they
  drain system performance noticeably to provide userland functionality.
 [citation needed])

  It can also be used to automatically update directory views, reload
  configuration files, log changes, backup, synchronize, and upload.
